You need to fill in the accounts in the hardhat.config.js as the private key of the deployment contract account

# deploy Eigen contract on L1

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localzkevmL1
```

# deploy Eigen contract on L2

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localzkevmL2
```
